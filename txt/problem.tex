Alas, most software is written for a small subset of the population. 
H5P\footnote{\url{http://h5p.org/}} is one of many novel examples of software 
providing added-value to tech-savvy teachers and educational software 
developers. However, the BOP would in this case be the students.

By providing the correct tooling and educational framework, we could enable 
students to act not only as users of off-the-shelf educational software, but 
also as authors of their own or their co-students' learning experience. By
doing so, we could allow the student to feel some degree of pride in the
coursework. Moreover, it would allow for reinforced learning, as well as viral 
effects (sharing), a major force in the modern network economy.

Such a framework would also encourage the students to make services and tools
more adapted to their particular learning situation, improving the overall
user experience. It would additionally be a valuable source of inspiration for 
educational software developers and user experience designers. And if 
successful, usage data would be interesting for analytics research.

Sadly, such a framework doesn't exist. So we want to move H5P closer to being 
one. In order to achieve this we provide intuitive composition of H5P modules, 
and, ultimately, of all kinds of e-learning modules, including new ones.
