Alas, most software is written for only a small subset of the population. 
H5P\footnote{\url{http://h5p.org/}} is one of many novel examples of software 
providing added-value to tech-savvy teachers and educational software 
developers. However, the BOP would in this case be the students.

By providing the correct tooling and educational framework, we enable students
to act not only as users of off-the-shelf (OTS) educational software, but
also as authors of their own or their co-students' learning experience. By
doing so, we allow the student to feel some degree of ownership to the
coursework, allowing for reinforced learning, as well as sharing (viral) effects
(perhaps due to pride), a major force in the modern network economy.

Such a framework would also encourage the students to create services and tools
more adapted to their particular learning situation, allowing for an overall
better user experience, as well as a valuable source of inspiration (and usage
data/analytics) for educational software developers and user interface
designers.
