Our idea is a canvas for authoring e-learning modules, initially targeting 
H5P. It should be intuitive to use, yet potent enough to make sufficiently 
refined modules. A simple user interface is vital to construct a ladder out 
from the BOP, whilst a capable set of features is important to attract users 
in general. Via gamification, users are encouraged to share their modules, and 
to improve the modules of others.
