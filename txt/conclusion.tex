Our idea is a canvas for composing e-learning modules, initially targeting 
H5P. It should be intuitive to use, yet potent enough to make sufficiently 
refined modules. A simple user interface is vital to construct a ladder out 
from the BOP, whilst a capable set of features is important to attract users 
in general. Via gamification, users are encouraged to share their modules, and 
to improve the modules of others. We encourage a self-regulating community 
that promotes quality through a rating system for modules.

By authoring modules, the student becomes the teacher, which leads to more 
effective learning. Learning by teaching is a powerful concept that enhances 
the self-efficacy of students.

The canvas system is an important step towards our goal. However, much remains 
to be done. We need to achieve a cohesive authoring experience. Either by 
making our own modules, or by figuring out a way to make e-learning modules 
authoring agnostic and cohesive at the same time.
