\subsection{Evaluation of Duolingo}

Duolingo is a solution providing spaced, paced learning. Users are presented
with different challenges, usually centered around words (for example their
pronounciation), and are able to advance through a hierarchy of lessons. Upon
completion of lessons, modules, levels etc. users are granted experience points,
which can be spent buying more attempts, in-game apparel, and so on. On
completing levels, the overall retention of the lesson is noted using a strength
bar. As time goes by, this retention decreases, and the user is prompted to
re-take lessons, not dissimilar to the system provided by Anki.

Users are able to perform simple tasks like translating individual words or
sentences, pronouncing them correctly (using a microphone), conjugating nouns
and verbs, and so on. This tasks usually come in sets, and such a set in turns
constitutes a module or level in the game. However, progression need not be
linear, and more proficient users can opt to perform tasks qualifying for more
advanced modules early on if so desired.

When performing a task, the user has a given set of hearts or HP. When they fail
a task, the count is decremented. Users can also opt for timed lessons.

\subsubsection{Expressiveness}

Not much, as Duolingo is a closed solution. Users usually do not create the
content they themselves consume.

\subsubsection{Ease of use}

Very simple. Quick feedback and positive reinforcement makes it simple to start
using the system. There aren't many options available, except for audio settings
(and other preferences), and the user interface is therefore easy to use.

\subsubsection{Misc}

\begin{itemize}
\item Duolingo allows users to translate texts to (im)prove their language
  proficiency, and uses community filtering to ascertain the quality of the
  translations. This is how the service pays for itself - as a mechanical turk
  for natural languages, currently partnering with CNN and
  Buzzfeed.\cite{duolingobuzz} It also provides language certification
  services.\cite{duolingocert}
\item Duolingo tracks metrics like what lessons people struggle the most with,
  adopting a wholesome data-driven approach. This and a flexible userbase allows
  them to iterate quickly on the content provided in the
  lessons.\cite{duolingodatadriven}
\item Users are able to provide feedback on tasks, for example whether a translation
  is reasonable or too hard at this proficiency level.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Takeaway points}

\begin{itemize}
\item Quick and simple feedback with additive gains facilitate user engagement
  greatly.
\item Community can be used to enhance or ensure the quality of lessons.
\item A data-driven approach might foster good community relations and provide more
  relevant, better content as well.
\end{itemize}
