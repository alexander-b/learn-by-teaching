In an effort to foster learning by teaching, we propose the development of a 
canvas system that makes authoring e-learning modules intuitive. We empower 
and liberate non-technical module users by turning them into module authors, 
which in turn stimulates learning through teaching. By making a damn fine 
piece of software, we furthermore make module authoring more pleasant for 
experienced authors as well. We propose a system that initially enables users 
to easily author H5P modules. These modules are successively easy to share and 
modify. Through gamification we encourage authors to share their work, and to 
improve the works of others.
