By developing a canvas that makes authoring e-learning modules intuitive, we 
empower and liberate non-technical module users by turning them into module 
authors. By making a damn fine piece of software, we furthermore make module 
authoring more pleasant for experienced authors as well. We propose a system 
that initially enables users to easily author H5P modules. These modules are 
in turn easy to share and modify. Through gamification we encourage authors to 
share their work, and to improve the works of others.
