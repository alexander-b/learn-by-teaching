In an effort to foster learning by teaching, we propose the development of a 
canvas system that makes composing e-learning modules intuitive. We try to 
empower and liberate non-technical module users by lowering the bar for 
turning them into module authors, a bar previously set far too high. In turn, 
this stimulates learning through teaching. By making a damn fine piece of 
software, we furthermore make module authoring more pleasant for experienced 
authors as well. We propose a system that initially enables users to easily 
compose H5P modules. These modules are successively easy to share and modify. 
Through gamification we encourage authors to share their work, and to improve 
the works of others.
