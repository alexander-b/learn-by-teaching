H5P has rudimentary editing support. It is unfortunately low-level. But at the 
same time it appears to be easy enough to integrate, which is ideal for our 
system. At any rate, H5P does not offer high-level composing of modules, which 
is our real novelty.

There does not appear to be any mature, publicly available e-learning module 
authors that achieves the sophistication we would enjoy seeing, especially in 
that our author should be well and truly general, capable of making genuinely 
diverse modules, from flashcards to memory games, from quizzes to mini-games. 
This is another misfortune.

Intuitive composing seems virtually unheard of. And a standalone 
module-agnostic composing tool appears to be a complete novelty.

However, there exist several authoring tools for the specific things we wish 
to accomplish. I.e.\ there are flashcard authoring tools, quiz authoring 
tools, etc. In this section we discuss those, as well as authoring tools for 
completely different things, and unconventional "authoring tools" like 
Minecraft.
