H5P used to have rudimentary editing support, but this appears to have been 
deprecated, leaving behind it a big hole. Moreover, our described idea is 
orders of magnitude more sophisticated than said editor ever was.

There does not appear to be any mature, publicly available e-learning module 
authors that achieves the sophistication we aim for, especially in that our 
author should be well and truly general, capable of making genuinely diverse 
modules, from flashcards to memory games, from quizzes to mini-games.

However, there exist several authoring tools for the specific things we wish 
to accomplish. I.e.\ there are flashcard authoring tools, quiz authoring 
tools, etc. In this section we discuss those, as well as authoring tools for 
completely different things, and unconventional "authoring tools" like 
Minecraft.
